        <!-- Instructions -->
        <div class="recipe-instructions">
            <p class="instruction-step">
                <strong>1 Roast the pork & broccoli:</strong><br>
                Place an oven rack in the center of the oven, then preheat to 450°F. Line a sheet pan with aluminum foil. Wash and dry the fresh produce. Cut off and discard the bottom 1/2 inch of the broccoli stem; cut the broccoli into large pieces, keeping the florets intact. Place on the sheet pan. Drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and pepper; toss to coat. Arrange in an even layer on one side of the sheet pan. Pat the pork dry with paper towels; season on all sides with salt, pepper, and the spice blend. Place on the other side of the sheet pan. Drizzle with olive oil; turn to coat. Roast, rotating the sheet pan halfway through, 26 to 28 minutes, or until the broccoli is browned and the pork is cooked through. (An instant-read thermometer inserted into the pork should register 145°F.) Remove from the oven. Transfer the roasted pork to a cutting board and let rest for at least 5 minutes.
            </p>
            <p class="instruction-step">
                <strong>2 Prepare the ingredients:</strong><br>
                While the pork and broccoli roast, peel and finely chop the garlic; using the side of your knife, smash until it resembles a paste (or use a zester). Core and medium dice the apple. Small dice the cheese.
            </p>
            <p class="instruction-step">
                <strong>3 Make the garlic breadcrumbs:</strong><br>
                While the pork and broccoli continue to roast, in a medium pan, heat a drizzle of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the breadcrumbs and half the garlic paste. Cook, stirring constantly, 2 to 3 minutes, or until golden brown. Transfer to a plate; immediately season with salt and pepper. Wipe out the pan.<br>
                While the pork and broccoli continue to roast, in the same pan, heat a drizzle of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the diced apple; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, 3 to 5 minutes, or until slightly softened. Add the vinegar and cook, stirring constantly, 30 seconds to 1 minute, or until the liquid has cooked off. Transfer to a bowl; season with salt and pepper to taste. Cover with aluminum foil to keep warm. Rinse and wipe out the pan.

                <strong>5 Make the cheese sauce:</strong><br>
                While the pork rests, in the same pan, heat 1 1⁄2 tablespoons of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the flour and remaining garlic paste; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring constantly, 30 seconds to 1 minute, or until lightly browned and fragrant. Add the milk and 1/2 cup of water; season with salt and pepper. Cook, whisking frequently, 2 to 3 minutes, or until thickened. Add the diced cheese; season with salt and pepper. Cook, whisking constantly, 1 to 2 minutes, or until the cheese has melted. Turn off the heat and season with salt and pepper to taste.
